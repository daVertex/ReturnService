# ReturnService

ReturnService is a fall-detection and recovery system designed to improve player retention by offering a Robux-based return option instead of forcing a full reset.

When a player falls or enters an invalid state, the system safely detects the failure and prompts the player with a paid return option, restoring them to a safe position while preserving progress.

Built to be lightweight, flexible, and easy to integrate into existing Roblox projects.
