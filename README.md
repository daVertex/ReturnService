ReturnService

ReturnService is a fall-detection and recovery system designed to improve player retention by offering a Robux-based return option instead of forcing a full reset. When a player falls or enters an invalid state, the system safely intercepts the failure and provides a seamless way to continue gameplay.

Built with performance and flexibility in mind, ReturnService integrates cleanly into existing game systems and supports checkpoint-based recovery without disrupting player progress.
